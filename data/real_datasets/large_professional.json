All cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.\nQuestion: Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer?\nAnswer: 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.<|endoftext|>"

While mutation analysis is important for predictive diagnosis in persons at risk, its relevance for clinical management of individual patients is open to question. We examined 680 unrelated FAP families for germline mutations in the APC gene. Clinical information was obtained from 1256 patients\nQuestion: Can APC mutation analysis contribute to therapeutic decisions in familial adenomatous polyposis?\nAnswer: As age at manifestation and course of the disease may be rather variable, even in carriers of identical germline mutations, therapeutic decisions should be based on colonoscopic findings in individual patients rather than on the site of mutation. However, in patients with mutations within codons 1445-1580, it may be advisable to postpone elective colectomy because desmoids may arise through surgical intervention.<|endoftext|>"

The purpose of this study was to define the current experience of residents on a vascular surgery service regarding the \nQuestion: Continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department: are trainees learning complete surgical care?\nAnswer: The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.<|endoftext|>"

The authors therefore hypothesise that \u03b2-catenin overexpression in SbCC of eyelid may be a result of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway dysregulation.

However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to\nQuestion: Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?\nAnswer: We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment.

This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their \nQuestion: Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?\nAnswer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.<|endoftext|>"
