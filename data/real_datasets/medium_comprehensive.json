Two speed discrimination experiments were conducted in a within-subject design.

For a given algorithm, sensitivity was determined by the proportion of reports simultaneously classified as drug related by the algorithm and the GI method. Specificity was measured\nQuestion: Can decisional algorithms replace global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs?\nAnswer: Decisional algorithms are sensitive methods for the detection of ADRs, but they present poor specificity.

There is mounting evidence that endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a vital role in these hemodynamic changes. We examined the possible role of intradialytic changes of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of hypotension and rebound hypertension during HD. The present study included 45 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular HD. They were divided according to their hemodynamic status during HD into three gro\nQuestion: Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis?\nAnswer: Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.<|endoftext|>"

These data were obtained from a prospective observational trial of women choosing the copper T380A IUD for EC. Insertions were performed by nurse practitioners at two family planning clinics in order to generalize findings to the type of service setting most likely to employ \nQuestion: Failed IUD insertions in community practice: an under-recognized problem?\nAnswer: The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.<|endoftext|>"

The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using\nQuestion: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation?\nAnswer: These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.<|endoftext|>"
