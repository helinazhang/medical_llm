Serologic tests reveal negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and positive antibody to surface antigen. Which of the following conditions does this serologic pattern best fit with? Options: (A) previous hepatitis B infection (B) chronic active hepatitis (C) acute hepatitis B infection (D) poor prognosis\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (A) previous hepatitis B infection. The antibody can be demonstrated in 80-90 of patients, usually late in convalescence, and indicates relative or absolute immunity. In contrast, HBsAg occurs very early and disappears in 6 months. Persistence of HBsAg indicates chronic infection. The pattern in this patient is also seen postvaccination, and perhaps as a consequence of remote infection."

Options: (A) Corynebacterium diphtheriae (B) Streptococcus group C (C) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (D) Streptococcus group A\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (D) Streptococcus group A. Streptococcus group A can cause a toxic shock-like syndrome, and has been increasing in frequency in North America. Streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome was so named because of its similarity to staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. The illness includes fever, hypotension, renal impairment, and the respiratory distress syndrome. It is usually caused by strains that produce exotoxin. It may be associated with localized infection as well; the most common associated infection is a soft tissue infection such as necrotizing fasciitis. The mortality is high (up to 30 ), usually secondary to shock and respiratory failure. The rapid progression of the disease and its high mortality demand early recognition and aggressive treatment. Management includes fluid resuscitation, pressor agents, mechanical ventilation, antibodies, and, if necrotizing fasciitis is present, surgical debridement."

The ratio of low to high molecular weight proteins in urine in various cases of syndrome is a manifestation of the selectivity of proteinuria. A highly selective proteinuria consists mostly of low molecular weight proteins, i.e. albumin transferrin, where as apoorly selective proteinuria consists of higher molecular weight globulin in addition to albumin.

The most noticeable side effect is skin discoloration, ranging from red to purple-black The degree of discoloration depending on the dose and amount of leprous infiltration. Urine, sputum and sweat may become pink. Clofazimine also produces a characteristic ichthyosis on the shins and forearms.

A nasal cannula is generally used wherever small amounts of supplemental oxygen are required, without rigid control of respiration, such as in oxygen therapy. Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44 . Rates above 5 L min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask. It is especially useful in those patients where vasoconstriction could negatively impact their condition, such as those suffering from strokes."

Inability to dorsiflex the toes is a grave sign of anterior compartment ischemia.

Scleroderma (refer to the image below) Autoimmune disease of connective tissue. Antinuclear antibodies are common but are usually present in a lower titer than in patients with SLE. Antibodies viually specific for scleroderma include:- Nucleolar autoantibodies (primarily against RNA polymerase) Antibodies to Scl-70, a non-histone nuclear protein topoisomerase; Anticentromere antibodies (associated with the CREST variant of the disease). The Scl-70 autoantibody is most common and specific for the diffuse form of scleroderma and is seen in 70 of patients. -Autoantibodies to double-stranded DNA (choice B) are seen in patients with SLE. -Autoantibodies to SS-A SS-B are seen in patients with Sjogren syndrome.

Options: (A) Increase in glucagon insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose (B) Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose (C) Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose (D) Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (A) Increase in glucagon insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose. A i.e. Increase in glucagons insulin ratio, increased C- AMP increased blood sugar.In diabetes little glucose is oxidized as fuel, except by the brain. The rest of tissues burn a large amount of fat, paicularly the liver where the amount of acetyl COA formed from fatty acids exceeds the capacity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle to oxidize it. The excess acetyl COA is conveed to ketone bodies l t ketonemia, ketonuria ketoacidosisDiabetics not only have a defect in the tissue utilization of glucose but also appears to be metabolically poised to produce maximum amount of glucose from amino acids (gluconeogenesis) and to prevent glucose from being utilized to to form fat.

Ans: D (Kawasaki disease) Ref: Manual of Emergency Critical Care Ultrasound Vicke E Noble. 2nd ed. Pg 156Explanation:Kawasaki disease is associated with hydrops of gallbladder.Gallbladder Wall Thickening A gallbladder wall that is thickened is a sign of inflammation. This is a non-specific finding, and many other pathologic processes, as well as a postprandial gallbladder, can give you falsely elevated measurements.It is important to measure the wall of the anterior gallbladder surface because of the acoustic enhancement artifact mentioned.Because sound waves travel through a fluid-filled structure, no attenuation occurs. Thus, when those sound weaves hit the back of the gallbladder, they will be so strong that they will obscure an accurate picture of the wall thickness.For gallbladder wall thickness, greater than 3 mm is abnormal.Differential for Thickened Gallbladder WallPostprandialRenal failureAscitesHepatitisHypoalbuminemiaHIV AIDSAdenomyomatosisMultiple myelomaCholecystitisCongestive heart failure"

This question is not about the diagnostic features of PTSD. This is about the differential diagnosis. PTSD is an anxiety disorder and it shares symptoms with other disorders. Impoant features in distinguishing the condition are given below. Differential diagnosis: Point 1: Etiologically significant trauma should be present for a diagnosis of PTSD. E.g. A traumatic event in the past. Point 2: Intentionality or aboutness is an impoant factor for PTSD. Nightmares, flashbacks or reliving experiences should be related to the past event. PTSD concerns memory - Intrusion of past stressors into the present. Point 3: Avoid a stimulus or activity that provokes the memory of the past event. In the above question, only reliving experience is mentioned as connected to the past experiences. Hence, that is the answer for this question. All other symptoms can be see in other anxiety disorders. Ref: Kaplan Sadock s, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 9th Edition, Page 2659"
