Ans. is b i.e., Subluxation of head of radius Pulled elbowo If a young child is lifted by the wrist, the head of the radius may be pulled partly out of the annular ligament, i.e., subluxation of the head of the radius.o Ir occurs when forearm is pronated, elbow is extended and longitudinal traction is applied to the hand or wrist, e.g., lifting, spinning or swinging a child with wrist or hand. Pulled elbow most commonly occurs between the age of 2-5 years.Clinical features of pulled elbowo History of sudden axial pull on extended elbow.o Immediately child starts crying and is unable to move the affected elbow.o The forearm is held in pronation and extension and any attempt to supinate is resisted,o Child does not allow to touch the affected limb,o X-ray seems to be normal.Treatment of pulled elbowo Treatment is simple. The child s attention is diverted, the elbow is quickly supinated and then slightly flexed.o This reduces the subluxation or dislocation and the radial head is relocated with a snap."

(A) Sarcoidosis OCULAR MANIFESTATIONS OF SARCOIDOSIS: Anterior segment: Conjunctival involvement has been reported in patients with ocular sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis granulomas are solitary, yellow millet-seed nodules. Anterior uveitis occurs in 22 - 70 of patients with ocular sarcoidosis, and is usually granulomatous chronic. Iris nodules have been reported in up to 12.5 of patients with sarcoidosis associated uveitis. Exacerbations of granulomatous uveitis are often associated with an appearance of fresh iris or fundus nodules. Posterior synechiae, cataract and glaucoma are common complications. Corneal band keratopathy develops in a few patients and is usually associated with hypercalcemia. Posterior segment: The most common manifestations at the posterior segment are vitritis, intermediate uveitis, panuveitis, posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis optic nerve involvement. Other manifestations include choroidal nodules exudative retinal detachment. Overall, patients with chronic posterior uveitis and panuveitis have significantly more complications than do patients with anterior uveitis.

It supplies the maxillary sinus, the maxillary incisors, canine and premolar teeth, and the skin of the cheek below the orbit. The supraorbital aery is another branch of the maxillary aery. It comes through the supraorbital foramen and supplies blood to the muscles, skin and fascia of the forehead. The lacrimal aery is a branch of the ophthalmic aery that supplies the lacrimal gland. The nasociliary aery doesn t exist, but there is a nasociliary nerve that travels with the ophthalmic aery. Ref: Moon D.A., Foreman K.B., Albeine K.H. (2011). Chapter 18. Orbit. In D.A. Moon, K.B.

The synthesis and secretion of hCG begins about day 6 of pregnancy, presumably from the trophoblast cells. Pregnancy tests utilize the measurement of hCG for detection of the embryo. Endothelial growth factor (EGF) is synthesized by the cytotrophoblast cells in the early placenta, then is synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast cells later (6-8 week old placenta). EGF maintains the trophoblast. Relaxin is synthesized by decidual cells at the time of paurition and acts to soften the cervix and pelvic ligaments. IGF act similarly to EGF by stimulating differentiation of the cytotrophoblast cells. HCS is synthesized by syncytiotrophoblast cells and will promote general growth.

POST-OPERATIVE ILEUS - Following most abdominal operations or injuries, the motility of GI tract is transiently impaired. - Proposed mechanisms responsible for this dysmotility are surgical stress-induced sympathetic reflexes, inflammatory response mediator release, and anesthetic analgesic effects; each of which can inhibit intestinal motility. Return of normal motility: small intestineQ (within 24 hours) Gastric (48 hours)Q Colonic(3-5 days) Post-operative ileus is most pronounced in colon. - Because small bowel motility is returned before colonic and gastric motility, listening for bowel sounds is not a reliable indicator that ileus has fully resolved."

THYROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS AND SECRETIONThyroid hormones are synthesized in the colloid, near the apical cell membrane of the follicular cells. Catalyzed by the enzyme thyroidal peroxidase, iodide in the thyroid cell is oxidized to iodine.The iodine enters the colloid and is rapidly bound at the 3 position to tyrosine molecules attached to thyroglobulin, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT).MIT is next iodinated at the 5 position, forming diiodotyrosine (DIT).Two DIT molecules then condense in an oxidative process ( coupling reaction ) to form one thyroxine (T4) molecule.Some T3 is probably formed within the thyroid gland by condensation of MIT with DIT. A small amount of reverse T3 (rT3) is also formed.In the normal thyroid, the average distribution of iodinated compounds is 23 MIT, 33 DIT, 35 T4, 7 T3, and 2 reverse T3."

In volume cycled ventilation the inspiratory flow rate is usually set at 60-100 U min to allow greater expiration time for each breath. Use of high inspiratory flow rate can minimize end inspiratory lung volume and intrinsic PEEP, but it can cause higher peak airway pressures. Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently. After the flow rate and profile are set the inflation time of machine is set and remains unresponsive to patients native cycling rythm and flow demands.

The occurrence of hyperglycemic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Similarly, persistent fasting hyperglycemia , even if it is asymptomatic, has been recommended by the National Diabetes Data Group as a criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes. However, abnormal glucose tolerance-whether after eating or after a standard glucose tolerance test -can be caused by many factors (e.g., anxiety, infection or other illness, lack of exercise, or inadequate diet). Similarly, glycosuria may have renal as well as endocrinologic causes. Therefore, these two conditions cannot be considered diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed in women between the twenty-fouh and twenty-eighth weeks of gestation, first using a 50-g oral glucose load if the I-h glucose level 7.8 mmol L (140 mg dL); a 100-g oral glucose test is performed after an overnight fast. Gestational diabetes is initially treated with dietary measures; if the postprandial glucose level remains elevated, insulin therapy is often staed.

Females have a 30-50 lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancerRef: Bailey and Love, 27e, page: 1260"

Which of the following valvular hea lesion can be suspected- Options: (A) antral stenosis (B) Tricuspid regurgitation (C) Aoic stenosis (D) Aoic regurgitation\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (C) Aoic stenosis. Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Erythromycin is metabolized through an induced P450 system, which requires increased heme synthesis. This leads to metabolite buildup to the level where the abdominal pain appears. The defect in heme synthesis does not affect creatine phosphate, cysteine, thymine, or methionine levels."

Dentinal dysplasia Dentinal dysplasia is an inherited condition affecting both dentitions. It is divided into two types: Type I (radicular dentinal dysplasia) and Type II (coronal dentinal dysplasia). It occurs less frequently than dentinogenesis imperfecta. Clinical features Type I is the more frequent type. Teeth erupt normally with no obvious abnormality but rapidly develop mobility resulting from limited root support. In type II, the deciduous teeth are similar to those in dentinogenesis imperfecta, whereas the permanent teeth appear normal. Radiological signs In Type I, all the teeth, except the canines, have extremely short roots. The roots are conical or blunted. There is pulpal obliteration and the inferior aspects of the crown exhibit linear crescent-shaped radiolucent lines. Periapical radiolucencies are commonly seen associated with non-carious teeth in Type I dentinal dysplasia. In Type II dentinal dysplasia, obliteration of the pulp occurs post eruption in the deciduous dentition. In the permanent dentition, there is alteration in the configuration of the pulp resulting in enlarged pulp chambers extending well down into the root. The pulp contains multiple calcifications.

The granulosa and theca cells of the follicle lining promptly begin to proliferate, and the clotted blood is rapidly replaced with yellowish, lipid-rich luteal cells, forming the corpus luteum.

(D) Occurs with Cirrhosis of liver PRIMARY (SPONTANEOUS) BACTERIAL PERITONITIS Peritonitis is either primary (without an apparent source of contamination) or secondary. The types of organisms found and the clinical presentations of these two processes are different. In adults, primary bacterial peritonitis (PBP) occurs most commonly in conjunction with cirrhosis of the liver (frequently the result of alcoholism). However, the disease has been reported in adults with metastatic malignant disease, postnecrotic cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, acute viral hepatitis, congestive heart failure, systemic lupus erythematosus, and lymphedema as well as in patients with no underlying disease. PBP virtually always develops in patients with ascites. While enteric gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli are most commonly encountered, gram-positive organisms such as streptococci, enterococci, or even pneumococci are sometimes found. In PBP, a single organism is typically isolated; anaerobes are found less frequently in PBP than in secondary peritonitis, in which a mixed flora including anaerobes is the rule. In fact, if PBP is suspected and multiple organisms including anaerobes are recovered from the peritoneal fluid, the diagnosis must be reconsidered and a source of secondary peritonitis sought."

The use of a tooth positioner rather than final settling archwires has two advantages: It allows the fixed appliance to be removed somewhat more quickly than otherwise would have been the case (i.e., some finishing that could have been done with the final archwires can be left to the positioner) It serves not only to reposition the teeth but also to massage the gingiva, which is almost always at least slightly inflamed and swollen after comprehensive orthodontic treatment. The gingival stimulation provided by a positioner is an excellent way to promote a rapid return to normal gingival contours. As a general rule, a tooth positioner in a cooperative patient will produce any changes it is capable of within 2-3 weeks. Final (post-treatment) records and retainer impressions can be taken 2 or 3 weeks after the positioner is placed. Beyond that time, if the positioner is continued, it is serving as a retainer rather than a finishing device-and positioners, as a rule, are not good retainers.

Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient? Options: (A) Administration of hypeonic saline solution (B) Restriction of free water (C) Plasma ultrafiltration (D) Hemodialysis\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (B) Restriction of free water. The initial, and often definitive, management of hyponatremia is free-water restriction. Symptomatic hyponatremia, which occurs at serum sodium levels less than or equal to 120 mEq L, can result in headache, seizures, coma, and signs of increased intracranial pressure and may require infusion of hypeonic saline. Rapid correction should be avoided so as not to cause central pontine myelinolysis, manifested by neurologic symptoms ranging from seizures to brain damage and death. Additionally, a search for the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia should be undeaken. Acute severe hyponatremia sometimes occurs following elective surgical procedures due to a combination of appropriate stimulation of antidiuretic hormone and injudicious administration of excess free water in the first few postoperative days. Other potential etiologies include hyperosmolarity with free-water shifts from the intra- to the extracellular compament (eg, hyperglycemia), sodium depletion (eg, gastrointestinal or renal losses, insufficient intake), dilution (eg, drug-induced), and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)."

Ref Robbins 9 e p224 Thymic Hypoplasia: DiGeorge Syndrome DiGeorge syndrome results from a congenital defect in thymic development with deficient T cell maturation. T cells are absent in the lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral blood, and infants with this defect are extremely vulnera- ble to viral, fungal, and protozoal infections. Patients are also susceptible to infection with intracellular bacteria, because of defective T cell-mediated immunity. B cells and serum immunoglobulins are generally unaffected. The disorder is a consequence of a developmental mal- formation affecting the third and fouh pharyngeal pouches, structures that give rise to the thymus, parathy- roid glands, and poions of the face and aoic arch. Thus, in addition to the thymic and T cell defects, there may be parathyroid gland hypoplasia, resulting in hypocalce- mic tetany, as well as additional midline developmental abnormalities. In 90 of cases of DiGeorge syndrome there is a deletion affecting chromosomal region 22q11, as discussed in Chapter 6. Transplantation of thymic tissue has successfully treated some affected infants.

Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that may protect against diuretic-induced digoxin toxicity.

Quinidine decreases digoxin volume of distribution and clearance. Verapamil also decreases the clearance of digoxin. Both drugs may thereby increase serum digoxin levels and precipitate digoxin toxicity.

Conjugation Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacteria through direct cell to cell contact or through a bridge- like the connection between two cells. Conjugation is a process whereby a donor (male) bacterium makes physical contact with a recipient (female) bacterium. Donor status is determined by the presence of plasmid. This plasmid codes for specialized fimbria (sex pilus) and for self-transfer. Sex pilus (conjugation tube) helps in transfer of genetic material from male bacterium to female bacterium. The plasmid is known as transfer factor (sex factor or fertility factor). The plasmid may be R factory which codes for transferrable multiple drug resistance. The DNA of the plasmid replicates during transfer so that each bacterium receives a copy Recipient becomes a donor and the donor retains its donor status."

Answer is A (5HIAA): The diagnosis of typical carcinoid tumors is done by measurement of 5HIAA levels. Diagnosis of Carcinoid Tumors (Harrison) The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome relies on measurement of urinary or plasma serotonin or its metabolites in the urine. Typical carcinoid syndrome (high level of serotonin) is characterized by high levels of 5HIAA. The measurement of 5HIAA is most frequently used for typical carcinoid syndrome. Most physicians only use urinary 5HIAA levels excretion rates however plasma and platelets serotonin levels if available provide additional information. Platelet serotonin levels (5-HT) are more sensitive than urinary 5HIAA levels but are not generally available. Atypical carcinoid syndromes (low levels of serotonin) may have normal or minimally elevated 5HIAA levels. In such patient s urinary levels of other tryptophan metabolites such as 5HTP should be measured. Elevated levels of urinary 5 HTP is suggestive of an atypical carcinoid syndrome."

Ans. B: Drugs affecting hea rate Chronotropic effects are those drugs that change the hea rate. Chronotropic drugs may change the hea rate by affecting the nerves controlling the hea, or by changing the rhythm produced by the sinoatrial node. Positive chronotropes increase hea rate; negative chronotropes decrease hea rate. A dromotrope affects Atrioventricular node (AV node) conduction. A positive dromotrope increases AV nodal conduction, and a negative dromotrope decreases AV nodal conduction. A lusitrope is an agent that affects diastolic relaxation. Inotropes affects contractility of the hea. Chronotropic variables in systolic myocardial performance can be split left and right. Left sided systolic chronotropy can be appreciated as Aoic Valve open to close time. Right sided variables are represented by Pulmonary valve open to close time.

Dry tap is usually defined as a failure to obtain bone marrow on attempted marrow aspiration . The diagnosis and management of many haematological diseases depends on examination of the bone marrow, which involves two separate specimens i.e. a cytologic and a histologic preparation.Bone marrow examination refers to the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained by bone marrow biopsy (often called a trephine biopsy) and bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy."

To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience."

Which of the following clinical findings is most likely to be characteristic of this group of patients? Options: (A) Cachexia (B) Cardiac murmur (C) Icterus (D) Loss of sensation\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (A) Cachexia. Cachexia is a common finding in advanced cancers, and weight loss without dieting in an adult is a red flag for malignancy. The exact cause for this is unknown, but increases in circulating factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may play a role. Cardiac murmurs may occur in the development of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, a feature of a hypercoagulable state that may occur with advanced malignancies. Icterus is most likely to occur when there is obstruction of the biliary tract by a mass (e.g., as in pancreatic cancer), but metastases are unlikely to cause such an obstruction. Neurologic abnormalities may occur in local tumor growth impinging on nerves, but dull constant pain is the most likely abnormality in malignant neoplasms that invade nerves. Metastases to the spleen are uncommon. Tympany is uncommon in cancer because obstruction by a mass tends to be incomplete and to develop over a long time.

Syndrome (Gustatory Sweating) aka auriculotemporal syndrome: Frey s syndrome arises as a complication of parotid surgery usually manifesting several months after the operation. lt is characterised by sweating and flushing of the preauricular skin during mastication causing nuisance to the person or social embarrassment. It is the result of damage to auriculotemporal nerve and aberrant innervation of sweat glands by parasympathetic secretomotor fibres which were destined for the parotid. Now instead of causing salivary secretion from the parotid, they cause secretion from the sweat glands. The condition can be treated by tympanic neurectomy which intercepts these parasympathetic fibres at the level of middle ear. Some people like to place a sheet of fascia lata between the skin and the underlying fat to prevent secretomotor fibres reaching the sweat glands. Generally, no treatment other than reassurance is required in most of these patients. Also known as Crocodile tears (gustatory lacrimation): There is unilateral lacrimation with mastication. This is due to faulty regeneration of parasympathetic fibres which now supply lacrimal gland instead of the salivary glands.

Ans. is b i.e., Oxidative stress Normally RBCs are protected from oxidant injury by reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is generated from oxidized glutathione and the reducing equivalent for this reaction is provided by NADPH. This NADPH is generated in HMP shunt by enzyme Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, while oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate. If G6PD is deficient, NADPH production will be reduced that results in increased susceptibility of RBC to oxidative damage because of unavailability of reduced glutathione. So, whenever there is oxidant stress, e.g. by drugs, infection or foods, hemolysis occurs. G6PD deficiency causes episodic intravascular and extravascular hemolysis."

Ref: Ref: Harrisons 18 e p e-45 chapter As the depth of coma increases, the EEG becomes nonreactive and may show a burst-suppression pattern, with bursts of mixed-frequency activity separated by intervals of relative cerebral inactivity. In other instances there is a reduction in amplitude of the EEG until eventually activity cannot be detected. Such electrocerebral silence does not necessarily reflect irreversible brain damage, because it may occur in hypothermic patients or with drug overdose. The prognosis of electrocerebral silence, when recorded using an adequate technique, depends upon the clinical context in which it is found. In patients with severe cerebral anoxia, for example, electrocerebral silence in a technically satisfactory record implies that useful cognitive recovery will not occur."

Arterial hypoxemia is defined as an arterial P02 (partial pressure of oxygen) less than 80 mmHg, who is breathing room air at sea level. And because the partial pressure of a gas is determined by the soluble fraction of gas and not by the amount carried chemically bound to hemoglobin - the Hb does not determine P02 and hypoxemia does not depend on Hb level. In CO poisoning effective hemoglobin that can carry O2 decreases (because CO occupies Hb binding site) since P02 or arterial blood O2 remains normal, peripheral chemoreceptors are not stimulated and hyperventilation is not seen. In hypoxia, with the reduction of PO2 cerebral blood flow increases (d t vaso dilatation)to maintain O2 delivery in the brain. The cerebral cortex can tolerate acute hypoxia for 5-10 min at 28 C, 20 min at 20 C, and 50 min at 50 C. Hypoxic ischemia almost invariably involve hippocampus.

External oblique: Most superficial muscle which originates from the outer pa of the 5th to 12th ribs on each side of the rib cage. This muscle then runs diagonally down each side and connects to the iliac crest, linea alba, and the pubis. Function: External oblique contributes to the maintenance of abdominal tone, increasing intra-abdominal pressure (as in active expiration), and lateral flexion of the trunk against resistance. Bilateral contraction flexes the trunk forward and aid in movement of spine and back. Contraction of external oblique muscle approximates the two crura (medial and lateral) of superficial inguinal ring like a slit valve to maintain the integrity of inguinal canal."

No mucosal ulceration is seen. Options: (A) Active chronic gastritis (B) Acute gastritis (C) Autoimmune gastritis (D) Chronic gastritis\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (B) Acute gastritis. Gastritis is a nonspecific term that describes any inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Acute gastritis refers to the clinical situation of gastric mucosal erosions (not mucosal ulcers). Acute gastritis is also known as hemorrhagic gastritis or acute erosive gastritis. Acute gastritis is associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and coicosteroids, and also with alcohol, chemotherapy, ischemia, shock, and even severe stress. Two types of stress ulcers are Curling s ulcers, seen in patients with severe burns, and Cushing s ulcers, seen in patients with intracranial lesions. Grossly acute gastritis appears as multiple, scattered, punctate (less than 1 cm) hemorrhagic areas in the gastric mucosa. This is helpful in differentiating acute gastritis from peptic ulcers, which tend to be solitary and larger. Microscopically the gastric mucosa from a patient with acute gastritis is likely to reveal mucosal erosions, scattered neutrophils, edema, and possibly hemorrhage. Acute gastritis.

In fact, data from the era of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) suggest that clinical examination of the axilla is falsely positive \n\nQuestion: Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy?\n\n### Response:\nClinical axillary examination in breast cancer is subject to false-positive results, and is by itself insufficient justification for axillary lymph node dissection. If other means of preoperative assessment such as palpation- or image-guided fine needle aspiration are negative or indeterminate, then SLN biopsy deserves wider consideration as an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection in the clinically node-positive setting.

Ghrelin is structurally related to motilin and, together, they represent a novel family of gut-brain regulatory peptides. In addition to having a powerful effect on the secretion of growth hormone, ghrelin stimulates energy production and signals directly to the hypothalamic regulatory nuclei that control energy homeostasis. The study of ghrelin has extended our understanding of how growth is controlled and has shown that the stomach is an impoant component of this system."

Which of the following drug might be responsible for the condition: Options: (A) Diuretics (B) ACE inhibitors (C) Calcium channel blockers (D) Beta blockers\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (B) ACE inhibitors. The angiotensin-converting enzyme normally helps in conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which acts as a vasoconstrictor in case of hypovolemia. In addition to that, ACE also helps in the breakdown of bradykinin. When ACE inhibitors (captopril) are given, it inhibits ACE and in addition inhibits the breakdown of bradykinin also, which leads to accumulation of bradykinin level in the body. This increased level of bradykinin presents with a Dry cough, rashes, urticaria and angioedema."

Tuberculosis is the proto- type of a granulomatous disease caused by infection and should always be excluded as the cause when granulomas are identified. Granulomas may also develop in some immune- mediated inflammatory diseases, notably Crohn disease, which is one type of inflammatory bowel disease and an impoant cause of granulomatous inflammation in the United States.

The most likely cause of this woman s problem is Options: (A) Acute pulmonary embolism (B) CO2 absorption from induced pneumoperitoneum (C) Alveolar hypoventilation (D) Pulmonary edema\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (C) Alveolar hypoventilation. Because of the ease with which carbon dioxide diffuses across the alveolar membranes, the PaCO2 is a highly reliable indicator of alveolar ventilation. In this postoperative patient with respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, the hypercarbia is diagnostic of alveolar hypoventilation. Acute hypoxemia can occur with pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, and significant atelectasis, but in all those situations the CO2 partial pressures should be normal or reduced as the patient hyperventilates to improve oxygenation.

To determine the impact of PRISM on LOS, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network s (ANN) performance to estimate LOS from PRISM item patterns.\n\nQuestion: Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay?\n\n### Response:\nThe ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, and LOS. This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.

Von Langenbeck Repair: Two-stage palate repairs were originally described as a means of treating wide clefts; soft palate repair was done at the same time as lip repair, with the hard palate repaired later after the cleft width had diminished. In a way, this is analogous to lip adhesion; the surgeon is committed to a second operation and has additional scar to confront at the time of the second procedure. The use of two-stage palate repair has consistently been shown to produce poorer speech results when compared with most single-stage techniques, but is still used by some surgeons."

Hypeension due to an occlusive lesion of a renal aery is renovascular hypeensionIn the initial stages, the mechanism of hypeension generally is related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Obstruction of the renal aery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion. Over time, possibly as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypeension may become less renin-dependent.As a screening test, renal blood flow may be evaluated with a radionuclide -ohoiodohippurate (OIH) scan, or glomerular filtration rate may be evaluated with a - diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) scan before and after a single dose of captopril (or another ACE inhibitor).Contrast aeriography remains the gold standard for evaluation and identification of renal aery lesions.Harrison 19e pg: 1618"

Options: (A) previous hepatitis B infection (B) chronic active hepatitis (C) acute hepatitis B infection (D) poor prognosis\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (A) previous hepatitis B infection. The antibody can be demonstrated in 80-90 of patients, usually late in convalescence, and indicates relative or absolute immunity. In contrast, HBsAg occurs very early and disappears in 6 months. Persistence of HBsAg indicates chronic infection. The pattern in this patient is also seen postvaccination, and perhaps as a consequence of remote infection."

Options: (A) Corynebacterium diphtheriae (B) Streptococcus group C (C) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (D) Streptococcus group A\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (D) Streptococcus group A. Streptococcus group A can cause a toxic shock-like syndrome, and has been increasing in frequency in North America. Streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome was so named because of its similarity to staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. The illness includes fever, hypotension, renal impairment, and the respiratory distress syndrome. It is usually caused by strains that produce exotoxin. It may be associated with localized infection as well; the most common associated infection is a soft tissue infection such as necrotizing fasciitis. The mortality is high (up to 30 ), usually secondary to shock and respiratory failure. The rapid progression of the disease and its high mortality demand early recognition and aggressive treatment. Management includes fluid resuscitation, pressor agents, mechanical ventilation, antibodies, and, if necrotizing fasciitis is present, surgical debridement."

A nasal cannula is generally used wherever small amounts of supplemental oxygen are required, without rigid control of respiration, such as in oxygen therapy. Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44 . Rates above 5 L min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask. It is especially useful in those patients where vasoconstriction could negatively impact their condition, such as those suffering from strokes."

Options: (A) Increase in glucagon insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose (B) Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose (C) Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose (D) Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Response:\nThe correct answer is (A) Increase in glucagon insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose. A i.e. Increase in glucagons insulin ratio, increased C- AMP increased blood sugar.In diabetes little glucose is oxidized as fuel, except by the brain. The rest of tissues burn a large amount of fat, paicularly the liver where the amount of acetyl COA formed from fatty acids exceeds the capacity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle to oxidize it. The excess acetyl COA is conveed to ketone bodies l t ketonemia, ketonuria ketoacidosisDiabetics not only have a defect in the tissue utilization of glucose but also appears to be metabolically poised to produce maximum amount of glucose from amino acids (gluconeogenesis) and to prevent glucose from being utilized to to form fat.

Ans: D (Kawasaki disease) Ref: Manual of Emergency Critical Care Ultrasound Vicke E Noble. 2nd ed. Pg 156Explanation:Kawasaki disease is associated with hydrops of gallbladder.Gallbladder Wall Thickening A gallbladder wall that is thickened is a sign of inflammation. This is a non-specific finding, and many other pathologic processes, as well as a postprandial gallbladder, can give you falsely elevated measurements.It is important to measure the wall of the anterior gallbladder surface because of the acoustic enhancement artifact mentioned.Because sound waves travel through a fluid-filled structure, no attenuation occurs. Thus, when those sound weaves hit the back of the gallbladder, they will be so strong that they will obscure an accurate picture of the wall thickness.For gallbladder wall thickness, greater than 3 mm is abnormal.Differential for Thickened Gallbladder WallPostprandialRenal failureAscitesHepatitisHypoalbuminemiaHIV AIDSAdenomyomatosisMultiple myelomaCholecystitisCongestive heart failure"

This question is not about the diagnostic features of PTSD. This is about the differential diagnosis. PTSD is an anxiety disorder and it shares symptoms with other disorders. Impoant features in distinguishing the condition are given below. Differential diagnosis: Point 1: Etiologically significant trauma should be present for a diagnosis of PTSD. E.g. A traumatic event in the past. Point 2: Intentionality or aboutness is an impoant factor for PTSD. Nightmares, flashbacks or reliving experiences should be related to the past event. PTSD concerns memory - Intrusion of past stressors into the present. Point 3: Avoid a stimulus or activity that provokes the memory of the past event. In the above question, only reliving experience is mentioned as connected to the past experiences. Hence, that is the answer for this question. All other symptoms can be see in other anxiety disorders. Ref: Kaplan Sadock s, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 9th Edition, Page 2659"
