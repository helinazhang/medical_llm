Secretin causes alkaline pancreatic juice to flood into the duodenum, neutralizing the acid from the stomach and thus inhibiting further secretion of the hormone - feedback control.

Red (or hemorrhagic) infarcts: They found in tissues that have a double blood supply--eg, lung and liver--or in tissues such as intestine that have collateral vessels permitting some continued flow into the area although the amount is not sufficient to prevent infarction. The infarct is red because of extravasation of blood in the infarcted area from necrotic small vessels. Red infarcts may also occur in tissue if dissolution or fragmentation of the occluding thrombus permits reestablishment of aerial flow to the infarcted area. Venous infarcts are always associated with congestion and hemorrhage. They are red infarcts. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998). Chapter 9. Abnormalities of Blood Supply. In P. Chandrasoma, C.R.

The use of a tooth positioner rather than final settling archwires has two advantages: It allows the fixed appliance to be removed somewhat more quickly than otherwise would have been the case (i.e., some finishing that could have been done with the final archwires can be left to the positioner) It serves not only to reposition the teeth but also to massage the gingiva, which is almost always at least slightly inflamed and swollen after comprehensive orthodontic treatment.
