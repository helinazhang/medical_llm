Options: (A) Administration of hypeonic saline solution (B) Restriction of free water (C) Plasma ultrafiltration (D) Hemodialysis [/INST] The correct answer is (B) Restriction of free water. The initial, and often definitive, management of hyponatremia is free-water restriction. Symptomatic hyponatremia, which occurs at serum sodium levels less than or equal to 120 mEq L, can result in headache, seizures, coma, and signs of increased intracranial pressure and may require infusion of hypeonic saline. Rapid correction should be avoided so as not to cause central pontine myelinolysis, manifested by neurologic symptoms ranging from seizures to brain damage and death. Additionally, a search for the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia should be undeaken. Acute severe hyponatremia sometimes occurs following elective surgical procedures due to a combination of appropriate stimulation of antidiuretic hormone and injudicious administration of excess free water in the first few postoperative days. Other potential etiologies include hyperosmolarity with free-water shifts from the intra- to the extracellular compament (eg, hyperglycemia), sodium depletion (eg, gastrointestinal or renal losses, insufficient intake), dilution (eg, drug-induced), and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).</s>"

It is the result of damage to auriculotemporal nerve and aberrant innervation of sweat glands by parasympathetic secretomotor fibres which were destined for the parotid. Now instead of causing salivary secretion from the parotid, they cause secretion from the sweat glands. The condition can be treated by tympanic neurectomy which intercepts these parasympathetic fibres at the level of middle ear. Some people like to place a sheet of fascia lata between the skin and the underlying fat to prevent secretomotor fibres reaching the sweat glands. Generally, no treatment other than reassurance is required in most of these patients. Also known as Crocodile tears (gustatory lacrimation): There is unilateral lacrimation with mastication. This is due to faulty regeneration of parasympathetic fibres which now supply lacrimal gland instead of the salivary glands.

This question is not about the diagnostic features of PTSD. This is about the differential diagnosis. PTSD is an anxiety disorder and it shares symptoms with other disorders. Impoant features in distinguishing the condition are given below. Differential diagnosis: Point 1: Etiologically significant trauma should be present for a diagnosis of PTSD. E.g. A traumatic event in the past. Point 2: Intentionality or aboutness is an impoant factor for PTSD. Nightmares, flashbacks or reliving experiences should be related to the past event. PTSD concerns memory - Intrusion of past stressors into the present. Point 3: Avoid a stimulus or activity that provokes the memory of the past event. In the above question, only reliving experience is mentioned as connected to the past experiences. Hence, that is the answer for this question.

A nasal cannula is generally used wherever small amounts of supplemental oxygen are required, without rigid control of respiration, such as in oxygen therapy. Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44 . Rates above 5 L min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask.

Ch 11 ACEI inhibits the converting enzyme peptidyl dipeptidase that hydrolyzes angiotensin I to angiotensin II and (under the name plasma kininase) inactivates bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, which works at least in part by stimulating release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Drugs under this class are: Captopril, Enalapril, Lisinopril, Benazepril, fosinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril. ACE inhibitors have a particularly useful role in treating patients with chronic kidney disease because they diminish proteinuria and stabilize renal function (even in the absence of lowering of blood pressure). ACE inhibitors have also proved to be extremely useful in the treatment of heart failure, and after myocardial infarction, and There is recent evidence that ACE inhibitors reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with high cardiovascular risk.</s>"

Ref Robbins 9 e p224 Thymic Hypoplasia: DiGeorge Syndrome DiGeorge syndrome results from a congenital defect in thymic development with deficient T cell maturation. T cells are absent in the lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral blood, and infants with this defect are extremely vulnera- ble to viral, fungal, and protozoal infections. Patients are also susceptible to infection with intracellular bacteria, because of defective T cell-mediated immunity. B cells and serum immunoglobulins are generally unaffected. The disorder is a consequence of a developmental mal- formation affecting the third and fouh pharyngeal pouches, structures that give rise to the thymus, parathy- roid glands, and poions of the face and aoic arch. Thus, in addition to the thymic and T cell defects, there may be parathyroid gland hypoplasia, resulting in hypocalce- mic tetany, as well as additional midline developmental abnormalities. In 90 of cases of DiGeorge syndrome there is a deletion affecting chromosomal region 22q11, as discussed in Chapter 6. Transplantation of thymic tissue has successfully treated some affected infants.

Typical carcinoid syndrome (high level of serotonin) is characterized by high levels of 5HIAA. The measurement of 5HIAA is most frequently used for typical carcinoid syndrome. Most physicians only use urinary 5HIAA levels excretion rates however plasma and platelets serotonin levels if available provide additional information. Platelet serotonin levels (5-HT) are more sensitive than urinary 5HIAA levels but are not generally available. Atypical carcinoid syndromes (low levels of serotonin) may have normal or minimally elevated 5HIAA levels.

Options: (A) Cachexia (B) Cardiac murmur (C) Icterus (D) Loss of sensation [/INST] The correct answer is (A) Cachexia.

Neurologic abnormalities may occur in local tumor growth impinging on nerves, but dull constant pain is the most likely abnormality in malignant neoplasms that invade nerves.

The occurrence of hyperglycemic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Similarly, persistent fasting hyperglycemia , even if it is asymptomatic, has been recommended by the National Diabetes Data Group as a criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes. However, abnormal glucose tolerance-whether after eating or after a standard glucose tolerance test -can be caused by many factors (e.g., anxiety, infection or other illness, lack of exercise, or inadequate diet). Similarly, glycosuria may have renal as well as endocrinologic causes. Therefore, these two conditions cannot be considered diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed in women between the twenty-fouh and twenty-eighth weeks of gestation, first using a 50-g oral glucose load if the I-h glucose level 7.8 mmol L (140 mg dL); a 100-g oral glucose test is performed after an overnight fast.

Dilatation of post arteriolar capillaries which is again because of loss of sympathetic tone. Decreased cardiac output which is because of: Decreased venous return: Due to blood pooling in veins of lower limb and lower abdomen. Bradycardia: Bradycardia can occur as a result of: Decreased atrial pressure because of decrease venous return (Bainbridge reflex) and Direct inhibition of cardioaccelerator fibres (T1 to T4).

Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Inward movement is accomplished by the medial rectus, supplied by the oculomotor nerve. Downward movement in the midline is accomplished by joint activation of the superior oblique and inferior rectus muscle. Downward movement of the pupil from the adducted position is a function of the superior oblique alone, which is supplied by the trochlear nerve. Down and out motion is mediated by the combined actions of the lateral rectus and inferior rectus, which are innervated by the abducens and oculomotor nerves. Downward movement of the pupil from a forward gaze is a result of combined actions of inferior rectus and superior oblique muscles, supplied by oculomotor and trochlear nerves, respectively.</s>"

PBP virtually always develops in patients with ascites. While enteric gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli are most commonly encountered, gram-positive organisms such as streptococci, enterococci, or even pneumococci are sometimes found. In PBP, a single organism is typically isolated; anaerobes are found less frequently in PBP than in secondary peritonitis, in which a mixed flora including anaerobes is the rule.

Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have hea problems, a small head, and low bih weight. Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder inherited from a person s parents. It is due to mutations in the PAH gene which results in low levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This results in the build up of dietary phenylalanine to potentially toxic levels. It is autosomal recessive meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to develop.

Of the conditions listed, only pancreatic head tumors are associated with an increase in conjugated ( direct ) bilirubin (obstructive jaundice). Increased levels of unconjugated ( direct ) bilirubin result from hemolysis over liver defects that impair uptake or conjugation mechanism in liver cells (Gilbe s syndrome, Crigler- Najjar syndrome) positive. Unconjugated bilirubin may cross the immature blood brain Barrier of the newborn and cause Kernicterus. The physiologic jaundice of the newborn observed during the first week of bih is usually mild and due to relatively immature liver conjugation. Ref: Cothren C., Biffl W.L., Moore E.E. (2010).

Dens in Dente (Dens invaginatus, dilated composite odontome) The dens in dente is a developmental variation which is thought to arise as a result of an invagination in the surface of tooth crown before calcification has occurred. Several causes of this condition have been proposed. These include increased localized external pressure, focal growth retardation, and focal growth stimulation in certain areas of the tooth bud. The permanent maxillary lateral incisors are the teeth most frequently involved, and in the majority of cases the dens in dente appears to represent simply an accentuation in the development of the lingual pit. Radiological signs Dens in dente represent a tooth-shaped, enamel-covered mass within the crown and or root of the tooth but which may traverse the length of the tooth.

The next step in management should be Options: (A) Electromyography (EMG) (B) Measurement of anterior compartment pressure (C) Elevation of the left leg (D) Immediate fasciotomy [/INST] The correct answer is (D) Immediate fasciotomy. This case illustrates two (among many) conditions that lead to the anterior compartment syndrome, namely, acute arterial occlusion without collateral inflow and rapid reperfusion of ischemic muscle. Treatment for a compartment syndrome is prompt fasciotomy Assessing a compartment syndrome and proceeding with fasciotomy are generally based on clinical judgment. Inability to dorsiflex the toes is a grave sign of anterior compartment ischemia. EMG studies and compartment pressure measurements would probably be abnormal but are unnecessary in view of the known findings and would delay treatment. Mere elevation of the leg would be an ineffective means of relieving compartment pressure, although elevation should accompany fasciotomy.

The treatment for hyperkalemia can be thought of in 3 distinct steps. First, antagonize the effects of hyperkalemia at the cellular level (membrane stabilization). Second, decrease serum potassium levels by promoting the influx of potassium into cells throughout the body.(insulin,beta2 agonist) Third, remove potassium from the body.(k resins) In cells with calcium-dependent action potentials, such as SA and atrioventricular nodal cells, and in cells in which the sodium current is depressed, an increase in extracellular calcium concentration will increase the magnitude of the calcium inward current and the Vmax by increasing the electrochemical gradient across the myocyte. This would be expected to speed impulse propagation in such tissues, reversing the myocyte depression seen with severe hyperkalemia. The effects of intravenous calcium occur within 1 to 3 minutes but last for only 30 to 60 minutes. Therefore, fuher, more definitive treatment is needed to lower serum potassium levels. Calcium gluconate is the preferred preparation of intravenous calcium. The dose should be 10 mL of a 10 calcium gluconate solution infused over 2 to 3 minutes.</s>"

Arterial hypoxemia is defined as an arterial P02 (partial pressure of oxygen) less than 80 mmHg, who is breathing room air at sea level. And because the partial pressure of a gas is determined by the soluble fraction of gas and not by the amount carried chemically bound to hemoglobin - the Hb does not determine P02 and hypoxemia does not depend on Hb level. In CO poisoning effective hemoglobin that can carry O2 decreases (because CO occupies Hb binding site) since P02 or arterial blood O2 remains normal, peripheral chemoreceptors are not stimulated and hyperventilation is not seen. In hypoxia, with the reduction of PO2 cerebral blood flow increases (d t vaso dilatation)to maintain O2 delivery in the brain. The cerebral cortex can tolerate acute hypoxia for 5-10 min at 28 C, 20 min at 20 C, and 50 min at 50 C. Hypoxic ischemia almost invariably involve hippocampus.

Ans. is d i.e., PMN s with fibrinoid necrosis with cellular infiltrates Polymorphonuclear leucocytes or neutrophils have a major role in acute inflammatory response. They are typically seen in acute inflammation. While granuloma formation is seen during chronic inflammatory response. The cells predominating during chronic inflammatory response are lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes etc. PMN s or neutrophils are typically absent during chronic inflammation. Granuloma contains Activated macrophages, i.e., epitheloid cells. Monocytes Lymphocytes Plasma cells Giant cells There are two types of giant cells 1. Langhans Giant cells Contains 3-5 nuclei Nuclei arranged peripherally (horse shoe) in the cytoplasm. 2. Foreign body cells Contains 3-5 nuclei Nuclei are arranged haphazardly in the cytoplasm. Langhans cells are the precursors of foreign body giant cells, as the numbers of nuclei increase langhans cells are conveed to foreign body giant cells So in early stage Langhans giant cells are predominant, while later on foreign body giant cells predominate. Foreign body giant cells can be arise directly from the fusion of macrophages also. So, Foreign body giant cells arise from ? 1. Langhans giant cells 2. Fusion of macrophages.</s>"

The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone.Alkaptonuria (black urine disease or alcaptonuria) is a rare inherited genetic disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. This is an autosomal recessive condition that is due to a defect in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, which participates in the degradation of tyrosine. As a result, a toxic tyrosine byproduct called homogentisic acid (or alkapton) accumulates in the blood and is excreted in urine in large amounts (hence -uria)</s>"

Ghrelin is structurally related to motilin and, together, they represent a novel family of gut-brain regulatory peptides. In addition to having a powerful effect on the secretion of growth hormone, ghrelin stimulates energy production and signals directly to the hypothalamic regulatory nuclei that control energy homeostasis. The study of ghrelin has extended our understanding of how growth is controlled and has shown that the stomach is an impoant component of this system.</s>"

Options: (A) Azoospermia (B) Germinal cell aplasia (C) Immotile sperm (D) Isolated gonadotropin deficiency [/INST] The correct answer is (C) Immotile sperm. The husband is suffering from Kaagener s syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by infeility, situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The underlying cause of these varied manifestations are defects in the dynein arms, spokes of microtubule doublets of cilia in the airways and the reproductive tract. Since sperm motility is dependent on the functioning of cilia, infeility frequently accompanies this disorder. Situs inversus occurs because ciliary function is necessary for cell migration during embryonic development. Azoospermia is not a feature of Kaagener s syndrome, as sperm production or survival is not affected in this disorder. Germinal cell aplasia, also known as Seoli only syndrome, is characterized by oligospermia or azoospermia.

Note that glucose transpo in some cells of body are insulin-independent - hepatocytes, RBCs, cells of nerveous system, corneal Insulin also activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (only in adipose tissue, not in liver) which catalyzes pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA the building blocks of fatty acids.

Red (or hemorrhagic) infarcts: They found in tissues that have a double blood supply--eg, lung and liver--or in tissues such as intestine that have collateral vessels permitting some continued flow into the area although the amount is not sufficient to prevent infarction. The infarct is red because of extravasation of blood in the infarcted area from necrotic small vessels.

Marfan Syndrome Is Caused by Mutations in the Gene for Fibrillin-1. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It affects the eyes (eg, causing dislocation of the lens, known as ectopia lentis), the skeletal system (most patients are tall and exhibit long digits and hyperextensibility of the joints), and the cardiovascular system (eg, causing weakness of the aoic media, leading to dilation of the ascending aoa). Abraham Lincoln may have had this condition. Most cases are caused by mutations in the gene (on chromosome 15) for fibrillin-1.Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene have also been identified as the cause of acromicric dysplasia and geleophysic dysplasia, which are characterized by sho stature, skin thickening, and stiff joints.
